# why is python a dynamis language?
# 1)readability
# 2)easy to understand
# 3)datatypes need not be defined
# Datatypes are listed below
# integer - 2,5,87
# float - 0.9, 1.6
# boolean - True, False
# string - 'neha', "golden", '''hello''' (triple quote is used for multiple lines)
# Data structure are of four types listed below:
# list - [1,79,True,'hello']
# tuple - ('blue',6,9,False)
# set - {34,676,False,'red'}
# dictionary - {1:'sneha',2:'hello'}
# Variables are used to store defined datatypes
# Variable can only start with a character or an underscore. 
# Variables cannot start with numbers.
# Variables cannot contain space.
# Variables are case-sensitive
# Comments are input given by user which are not executed with the code.
# Comments are used to increase readability and make the code easy to understand.
a=[2,5,'hello',True]
b=(2,5,'hello',True)
c={2,5,'hello',True}
d={1:2,2:5,3:'hello',4:True}
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
